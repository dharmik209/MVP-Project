# MVP-Project

The proposed project is centered on Machine Learning and its objective is to enhance security measures by capturing the face and name of individuals. The system is designed in a way that it cannot be operated without the correct face and name inputs, which makes it highly secure. This feature is especially useful in environments where children are present and accidental system triggering could occur. The operator must enter the correct face and name inputs to operate the system.

The primary purpose of this system is to automate the retail process and eliminate the need for human interaction. Retail store owners can install the system and avoid the necessity of employing staff to manage and monitor the store. The system provides customers with the ability to pay for their purchases through a subscription-based system, or through cash or online transactions. It captures the payment and fulfills the customer's order accordingly. The system's interface displays the available products for purchase, which the customers can browse through to find what they need.

The implementation of this system can provide significant benefits to store owners as it reduces the need for human resources, ultimately increasing profitability. For instance, a store owner with twenty employees who collectively earn a salary of 2 lakh rupees, can reduce their operating costs by utilizing this system and paying only 1 lakh rupees per month for the subscription. Furthermore, this system streamlines the entire retail process, making it more efficient and profitable for store owners.

In conclusion, the proposed system that leverages Machine Learning technology to capture face and name inputs for security measures and automates the retail process can revolutionize the retail industry. The system's integration can potentially reduce operational costs for store owners and enhance customer satisfaction by providing an efficient and secure retail experience.
